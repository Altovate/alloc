To use parts of alloc's functionality via SOAP services, you need to ensure
that the version of PHP on your server can run SOAP/WDSL etc. Have a look at
http://php.net/manual/en/ref.soap.php

To add new SOAP services, you must first add your methods to lib/alloc_soap.inc.php
and ensure that you adhere to the inline documentation conventions.

You must then run `make soap` from the top-level directory. This rebuilds the
alloc.wsdl file, using the inline PHP comments to generate accurate
input/output types etc.

SOAP clients can theoretically be written in any language that supports SOAP
and WSDL documents. There are a few examples in the demo directory.
