To use parts of alloc's functionality via SOAP services, you need to ensure that
your version of PHP can run SOAP/WDSL etc. Have a look at
http://php.net/manual/en/ref.soap.php


Also, note that in order to access the services you will need to change the path
at the bottom of the alloc.wsdl file.  The bit that looks like this:

<soap:address location='http://alloc_dev/soap/soapServer.php'/>

Needs to be updated with the path to the location of your instance of alloc.


The soapClient_* files should give you a rough understanding of how to write
soap client scripts in PHP. Of course they could be written in any language that
speaks SOAP+WSDL.
