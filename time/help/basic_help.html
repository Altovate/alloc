<br><br>
STAGE 1
<br><br>
1. Click on the "Time Sheets" menu item.<br>
2. Click on the link for a "New Time Sheet"<br>
3. When the page loads double check that this timesheet is going to credit your
   main TF account (as opposed to a shared TF account that you might also have
      access to).  If it is going to credit the wrong TF, or none at all then go
	     to the "Personal" menu item.  Choose your "Preferred Payment TF" and SAVE.<br>
		 4. Next from the drop down list of projects select the project that this time
		    sheet will be for.<br>
			5. Select whether or not you want to take on "Payment Insurance" for this time
			   sheet.<br>
			   6. Enter a "Billing Note" if necessary the billing note will be attached to all
			      emails that this timesheet will send off - to project manager - to admin and
				     back to you if the timesheet is rejected for resubmission for some reason.<br>
					 7. Click Save.<br>
<br><br>
					 STAGE 2<br><br>

					 1. A couple of extra buttons will have appeared next to the SAVE button.<br>
					         - "Re-Grab Pay Details"<br>
							         - "Save And Submit To Manager" or "Save and Submit to Admin"<br>
									 2. Below the buttons a new timesheet line entry has appeared.<br>
									 3. Fill in the details as applicable on the line entry and click the ADD
									    button to add this line entry to the timesheet.  A new line entry will
										   appear below the one you have just filled out.<br>
										   4. Continue filling out line entries for this timesheet until you have reached
										      a satisfactory total, or you have reached the amount that the invoice will
											     be for, for this timesheet.<br>
												 5. When you are done (over a period of weeks or whatever) click "Save and Submit
												    To Manager/Admin" button.  An email will be sent off to the manager or admin.<br>
													6. Additionally/Alternatively you can click the "Display a Friendly Version In
													   A New Window" Link in the top right hand corner to open a new browser window
													      with the Cybersoure timesheet as you are used to seeing it - and print out a
														     copy to get signed or whatever.<br><br>
