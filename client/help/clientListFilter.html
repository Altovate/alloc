<h1>Help - Client List Filter</h1>
<p>The client list filter allows you to reduce the number of clients listed by specifying some criteria.  You can specify the following criteria:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td>Status</td>
    <td>Limits the list to clients allocated to those set to the selected status (potential, current or archived).  The status is set using the Client Edit page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Name containing</td>
    <td>Limits the list to clients with names that contain the entered text.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Once you have entered your criteria, click the Apply button to load the list with your criteria applied.</p>
