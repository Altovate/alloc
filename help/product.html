<b>Product</b>

<br><br>

The <b>Sell Price</b> is the amount that you are selling the Product
for.

<br><br>

When a Sale is made, the Sell Price amount will be transferred from
the Incoming Funds TF to the Finance TF.

<br><br>

If the Sell Price is tax inclusive, then during a Product Sale
there will be additional line items for the tax, and the resulting
margin/profit will be lessened.
