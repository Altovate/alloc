<u>Quick List</u>
<br/><br/>

The Quick List dropdown contains actions that are used frequently. It also
stores a bit of your allocPSA browsing history. So if you were just editing a
Task and you've forgotten what it was called, take a look in the Quick List and
it might be there.



<br/><br/>
<u>Search</u>
<br/><br/>

The Search allows you to quickly search through the main entities in
allocPSA. If your search text is a number, ie an entity ID, then the search
will redirect you straight to that entity.
