<u>Quick List</u>
<br/><br/>

The Quick List provides easy access to frequently used actions. It also
stores your allocPSA browsing history. 


<br/><br/>
<u>Search</u>
<br/><br/>

The Search allows you to quickly search through the main entities in
allocPSA. If your search text is a number, (eg: a Task ID)
then the search will redirect you straight to that Task. Same for Projects etc.
