<u>Quick List</u>
<br><br>

The Quick List provides easy access to frequently used actions. It also
stores your allocPSA browsing history. 


<br><br>
<u>Search</u>
<br><br>

The Search allows you to quickly search through the main entities in
allocPSA. If your search text is a number and the category dropdown is set to
eg: "Tasks" then the search will redirect you straight to the Task with that
ID. This works with each of the entities in the search category dropdown list.
