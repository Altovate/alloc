<b>Add To Invoice</b>
<br/><br/>

Time Sheets can be added to an Invoice using the "Add To Invoice" button.  

<br><br>

Once the button is clicked a new Invoice Item will be added to an Invoice for
the Client of this Time Sheet.

<br><br>

If the "Multiple Items" checkbox is ticked, then each Time Sheet Item, will
appear as a separate Invoice Item. If the box is left unchecked, then only one
new Invoice Item will be added to the Invoice.

<br><br>

If no Invoice exists for the Client, a new Invoice will be created. 

<br><br>

If a Time Sheet is added to an Invoice and the Invoice is marked completed,
then all the associated Time Sheets will have their Transactions
approved or rejected depending on the outcome of the Invoice. And the Time Sheet
will be moved to status "Completed".

<br><br>

Therefore, whilst the Time Sheet is at the "Invoice" stage, it is
recommended that the Time Sheets Monetary Transactions should be created and
finalised, and left in a "Pending" state.
