<u>New Task Address</u>
<br><br>

Emails sent to this email address <b>by alloc users</b> will automatically get
turned into new tasks.

<br><br>

The subject line of the email becomes the task's name. The body of the email
becomes the task's long description.  Any attachments on the email will be
saved as attachments to the task.

<br><br>

Ensure the address you enter here is different to the "From Address" that you
specify above.

<br><br>

However, when emails are sent to the email address you enter for the "New Task
Address", the emails should get forwarded to the "From Address".
