<u>Payroll Tax Percent</u>
<br/><br/>

In Australia if work is done through an agency then the employee does not
need to pay a special tax called Payroll Tax (which is normally deducted by
the employing company without the employee being aware).  Within allocPSA if
you tick the checkbox of a Project marked "Through an Agency (Payroll Tax
Exempt)" then the percentage that the organization takes is lessened by the
percentage specified here.  

<br/><br/> 

So for example if the Company Percent field below is set to 30% and the
Payroll Tax is set to 5%. Then provided the Project has its "Through an Agency"
box checked, the amount that the Company will deduct will be 25% instead of 30%.
