<b>Create a reminder for this task</b>
<br><br>

Selecting this option will create a reminder for the assignee of this task,
based on the task priority. This will mean that the assignee recieves an email
about the task as soon as it is created, and a reminder until the task is
closed (or the reminder deleted).

This can be used, for example, to make sure phone messages are acted on.
