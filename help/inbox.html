<b>Manage Inbox</b>

<br><br>
Here you can see the current state of the alloc inbox.

<br><br>

Normally there should not be any messages in here, but if email is sent
directly to the mailbox and it doesn't have a {Key:foobar} in the subject line,
(or alloc doesn't know how to process the email for some other reason), then it
will remain here in the inbox.

<br><br>
Here's what the buttons do:

<br><br>
<b>New Task</b><br>
This will create a new task from the email. Using the subject line as the
Task's Name, and the body of the email as the Task's Description.
Any attachments in the email will be extracted and stored as task attachments.

<br><br>
<b>Process</b><br>
Will behave as though alloc just received the email, and begins the processing. Eg
the email is parsed for a {Key:} in the subject line, it figures out which task it belongs to,
which comment thread, it creates a new comment on that thread, it re-emails itself out to 
that thread's recipients. Etc. This function may be useful to see why particular emails
are failing to get processed correctly.

<br><br>
<b>Download</b><br>
Will fetch the complete email for download.

<br><br>
<b>Archive</b><br>
Will simply move the email to an archive folder where it will be out of the way.

<br><br>
<b>Mark Read / Mark Unread</b><br>
When alloc poll's the inbox automatically it checks for *new* emails that
haven't been read.  You can toggle a mail's "seen" flag to temporarily take a
mail out of the automated polling process - or more likely to re-insert it into
the queue.
