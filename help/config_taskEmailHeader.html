<u>Task Email Header and Footer</u>

<br><br> 
If Comment Template's are selected as the default Task Email
Header and Footer, then every email that passes through the task gateway will
have that extra text appended/prepended to the emails.

You can create new Comment Templates by going to the Tools menu, and then
selecting Comment Templates.
