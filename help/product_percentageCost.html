<b>Product Commissions</b>
<br><br>

Product Commissions determine how the margin on each sale of the Product
is distributed after all the Product Costs are paid.
<br><br>

The total of all Product Commissions should add up to 100%. If they do not,
the commissions will have to be adjusted when each individual sale is made.
