<b>Product Commissions</b>
<br><br>

Product Commissions specify how to distribute the margin/profit from
a Product sale.

<br><br>

The total of all Product Commissions should add up to 100% (to allocate
all of the margin/profit). If they do not, the commissions may have
to be adjusted when each individual sale is made.
