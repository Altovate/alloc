<b>Product Percentage Commissions</b>
<br/><br/>

Percentage commissions determine how the margin on each sale of the product are distributed
after all the fixed costs are paid. Entries here are not final and can be fine tuned when each
individual sale is made.

<br /><br />

The total of all commissions should add up to 100%. If they do not, the commissions will have to
be adjusted when each individual sale is made.
