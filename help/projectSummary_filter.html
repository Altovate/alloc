<b>Project Summary Filter</b>
<br/><br/>

This filter will allow you to filter the Tasks that are graphed for a Project
by Task Type and Task Status.

<br/><br/>

Multiple Task Types may be selected by holding Control or the Shift key whilst
clicking the items with your mouse.  

<br/><br/>

Note, in some web browsers after you click the Filter button, you may have
to do a hard refresh to avoid seeing the previously cached graph image.  You
can usually do this with an Ctrl-R, or Ctrl-Shift-R, or holding Control whilst
hitting the Refresh button with your mouse.
