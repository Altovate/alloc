<u>Time Sheet Payment Insurance Percent</u>
<br/><br/>

An option which our company uses in Time Sheets is called Payment Insurance.
This option lets an employee specify that they are not willing to wait for a
client to pay their invoice, so could they please get their funds from that
Time Sheet immediately. The cost of this is the percentage specified here. When
an employee nominates a particular Time Sheet to have Payment Insurance the
percentage of the Time Sheet is deducted from the employees Tagged Fund and
deposited into the Finance Tagged Fund. The remaining funds are then
immediately given to the employee.
