<u>Finance Tagged Fund</u>
<br/><br/>
 
Incoming funds can be imported into allocPSA via the Invoices or Wages Upload
screens. This setting allows the user to specify the Tagged Fund that the
money will be deposited into.  Also, Time Sheets use this Fund to withdraw money from
(if the Time Sheets Project doesn't have a default Tagged Fund set up already).
