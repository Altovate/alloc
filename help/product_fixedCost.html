<b>Product Fixed Costs</b>
<br/><br/>

Costs under this heading are costs that are fixed for each unit of the product sold, such has
hardware costs. The margin on each unit is calculated as the sale price of the product with the
sum of all fixed costs subtracted from it. This margin is then distributed based on the
percentages in the fields below.

<br /><br />

The sum of all fixed costs should be less than the sale price of the product.
