<H2 CLASS="western">Product Support</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Cybersource is able to offer you installation
support as part of your purchase, as well as hardware support for a
set period of time after your purchase. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The hardware is supplied with a 12 month,
return-to-base warranty.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The software supplied with the allocPSA is
warranted for operation for a period of 30 days from purchase.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Introduction</H1>
<P CLASS="western">Welcome to the user-level documentation for
allocPSA. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">allocPSA is an on-line (i.e. web-based)
Professional Services Automation system. allocPSA provides a suite of
integrated applications designed for organisations which provide
services to clients. It enables services personnel to become more
productive and profitable by increasing their efficiency through
increased utilisation and productive time, improved planning and
integrated knowledge management. It reduces the likelihood of
slip-ups and increases the traceability and manageability of
projects, expenses, tasks and people. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">allocPSA can streamline the process of allocating
staff resources to key projects, managing strategic initiatives at a
granular level, and can offer a platform for process collaboration
and knowledge reuse to any professional services business.</P>
<P CLASS="western">allocPSA consists of numerous software modules for
business areas such as: resource planning, project management, time
and expenses, fault &amp; issues tracking, message, announcement,
reminder and knowledge management, collaboration, services supply
chain, human resources and staff skilling and certification, item
loans and management of cost-centres. allocPSA offers integration
between the modules, as well as an open architecture and  integration
with existing external invoicing,bookkeeping and payroll systems.</P>
<P CLASS="western">allocPSA is intended for use in support daily
organisational operations, such as client contact, project
management, task and resource allocation, skills tracking,
time-sheeting, issues tracking, calendaring, reminders and
escalation, item loans, cost expenses and centres as well as
integration with existing external accounts and billing systems. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">allocPSA is made available as a server-based
appliance. By deploying an allocPSA system into your network, all
staff can access the application from any networked computer which
has a web browser. Depending on your network configuration and
security policies, staff can also access the allocPSA system from
external computers. Therefore, they can monitor tasks and submit
timesheets from home, or from any Internet-access point around the
world.</P>
<P CLASS="western">As a web-based application, users access allocPSA
via the standard web-browser they already have on their PCs. No
software needs to be installed on their PCs. Installation and
maintenance of allocPSA is therefore a simple and straightforward
affair. The new server is installed and configured in hours and all
users's PCs are able to access the allocPSA application immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western">allocPSA is open source software - you are
provided with full access to the complete source code under an open
source (GPL) licence. That means you have open-ended usage and code
modification access rights. This greatly reduces your business risks
in adopting allocPSA as a system element in your core business
operations. The product's source code will always be yours in
perpetual code escrow, at no additional cost.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Deployment</H2>
<P CLASS="western">allocPSA is supplied as a self-contained server
appliance unit. The server  appliance contains the operating system
platform, SQL server, web server and core allocPSA applications. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">allocPSA is an on-line, web-based suite. The core
system can be deployed in less than an hour, and requires no
workstation-level software installation, as allocPSA works with
almost any Internet-standard web-browser.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western">allocPSA can be used by hundreds of simultaneous
users, within your Local Area Network, campus network, wireless
network, Wide Area network or as an <SPAN LANG="en-GB">extranet</SPAN>
application by authorised personnel and partners from anywhere on the
Internet</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Open Source – Reducing Business Continuity
Risks</H2>
<P CLASS="western">allocPSA has been designed to offer your firm the
ultimate in flexible deployment integration and ongoing control. To
that end, the complete source code for allocPSA is supplied under a
GPL open source licence. You are then able to extend, modify or
maintain this code, should you so wish, or hire 3rd parties to
undertake this work for you.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Integration</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Cybersource maintains a full integration, support
and development team which is able to assist you in integrating
allocPSA into your organisation's information system architecture. In
fact, the price for allocPSA includes a pre-purchased quanta of
installation, customisation and support services.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Commercial Support</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Additional integration along with complete
commercial Service Level Agreement (SLA) support arrangement are
available. 24 x 7 x 365 allocPSA system and application monitoring
and alerting is also available.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Technology</H2>
<P CLASS="western">allocPSA is shipped on a server platform running
the open source Linux operating system, along with the PHP
application server engine and the MySQL database engine.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The allocPSA server appliance is built on
industry-standard commodity 1RU or 2RU rack-mounted x86 server
hardware. This hardware is expandable with standard computer
components.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The allocPSA appliance as shipped has sufficient
capacity to support several hundred concurrent users with no
problems. If higher numbers of  concurrent users are needed, higher
specification server hardware can be costed. There should be
sufficient storage capacity, in redundant (RAID mirrored disks) to
store upwards of 10 years of standard data. More capacity can easily
be added.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Customisation</H2>
<P CLASS="western">No two services businesses work the same way. To
provide for this reality,  allocPSA was designed and is intended to
be customised for each site. To that end, Cybersource offers your
firm a complete customisation service, whereby allocPSA can be
optimised for your work processes, your firm's accounting and billing
practices and the software used to implement these, or any other
site-specific requirements.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Alternatively, as allocPSA is completely open
source, you can elect to make any modifications in-house, or hire a
third-party to make any modifications. You are fully entitled to
select either course of action.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Features &amp;

</DIV><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H3 CLASS="western"></H3>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Tasks__Phases_How_it_Works"></A>How it
Works</H3>
<P CLASS="western">A Task is a unit of work or a work requirement
which needs to be accomplished. Tasks normally relate to specific
Projects. Tasks normally have start and finish dates. Most tasks are
normally allocated to a specific user (<SPAN LANG="en-US">i.e</SPAN>
a user resource in project management parlance). Tasks can have
associated descriptions, as well as priorities, and can be part of
other Tasks or of Phases. Tasks can also have a number of user
created comments, which can provide a running history of the task.<BR><BR>A
task can have Reminders associated with it which can be set to email
the specified owner of the task, or others within that project, on
certain dates and at certain times.<BR><BR>Once a task has been
completed, it can be marked off as 100% done. It will then be
archived within the Project, available in a Complete Task List, but
not shown in the normal operational view of the project. This reduces
the overall clutter.<BR><BR>A Phase is a special kind of Task, whose
primary purpose is to contain other tasks. Examples of a phases might
be 'Documentation' or 'Testing' or 'Planning' or 'Contract
Negotiation'. There is generally little different between a task and
a phase, except that a phase will be displayed in a  different in the
Task Graph.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Special Tasks: Faults</H4>
<P CLASS="western">In allocPSA a <I>fault</I> is a special kind of
task which exhibits particular behaviour with respect to the
automatic setting of reminders for the <SPAN STYLE="background: #e6e6ff">Person</SPAN>
to which the fault has been assigned, and to the Project's <SPAN STYLE="background: #e6e6ff">Manager</SPAN>
(if any) listed in the Project in which this fault was attached to,
as a form of <I>safety-net</I> escalation mechanism. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">While allocPSA does not purport to be a full
<I>Service Desk</I> solution, the tracking of faults as part of the
overall system framework provides quite a powerful system for
companies which provide service-level support to track, manage,
filter and archive any issues or problems which arise in the
day-to-day operation of any services organisation. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><I><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff66">NOTE</SPAN>:</I>
Only if appropriate email addresses have been configured for the
Project's Manager or the Person to whom the fault is assigned, will
there be any email notification possible.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Special Tasks: Messages</H4>
<P CLASS="western">In allocPSA, a <I>message</I> is a special kind of
task which exhibits particular behaviour with respect to the
automatic sending of the message via an email, as well as the setting
of email reminders for the Person to which the message has been
directed to, and to the Manager (if any) listed in the Project in
which this message was associated with, as a form of <I>safety-net</I>
escalation mechanism. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Normally, in most offices, a majority of messages
would be pasted onto a desk or computer screen by way of a
<I>sticky-note</I>, or perhaps sent as a one off email. Use the
message-task facility in allocPSA when you want to ensure that the
Person to whom you are sending this message to needs to sign-off on
the task, or that if they task is not signed-off in a reasonable
limit of time (as dictated by the Priority of the message) that an
email will be sent to an administrator or the Project's Manager. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><I><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff66">NOTE</SPAN>:</I>
Only if appropriate email addresses have been configured for the
Project's Manager or the Person to whom the message is directed to,
will there be any email notification possible.<BR><BR>Tasks in
allocPSA have a number of view. When creating a new task, you will be
presented with a view which primarily shows the <I>header
</I>information. Once this is saved, and from that point on, viewing
that task should show you the normal operational view of the task,
with much of the header information now made read-only. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">You can now process the task through its normal
<SPAN LANG="en-US">workflow</SPAN>, by adding comments upon each
atomic action of the tasks history, updating the percentage complete
and eventually closing the task off when it's been fully <SPAN LANG="en-US">realised</SPAN>
or judged complete. Finally, you can view a task with its full
details displayed on screen at once (referred to as the
printer-friendly view, as its the most conducive to grabbing a
hard-copy snapshot of the task in totality.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Tasks__Phases_How_to_Use"></A>How to Use</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Tasks have two editable <I>views</I>. The first
view is the <I>header</I> view, where you can establish a number of
attributes which are normally immutable (or change rather
infrequently.) The header view shows only a limited subset of all the
information which is normally associated with a task. Once you have
supplied whatever information you have and ensured that the task has
a name, you should then be able to Save the header component, and
allocPSA will then take this information and display it in read-only
form, while opening a number of new attributes which you can now set
or change. You may always re-enable editing of the task header, by
clicking on the <SPAN STYLE="background: #e6e6ff">'Detailed View'</SPAN>
link at the top of any fully-specified task.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<H3 CLASS="western">How it Works</H3>
<P CLASS="western">A Project is a logical entity which is constituted
by one or more people/resources/personnel working on one or more
tasks. Most Professional Services firms have very specific examples
of what constitutes a project. It might be implementing a new
computer system for their own use or for a Client. It might be in the
production of a report, or the development of a new device or item of
software. allocPSA is very flexible in terms of how it handles the
concept of a project, and how the life-cycle of a project is handled
in your organisation.<BR><BR>Much like a task, a Project has a <I>header</I>
component, which is not likely to change that frequently. Within this
header component are informational details about a the project,
including the project's name, who the Client is, project-specific
details about the Client's contact person, a number of start and
finish dates, along with project budget details, project manager (for
timesheet sign off purposes) and a project modification history.
<BR><BR>Once the <I>header</I> has been defined and saved, you will
be able to set any per-project assignment of Commission (used for
tracking revenues to account managers of salespeople within your
firm.) You can also establish which resources/personnel are assigned
to work on this project. Unless a resource is assigned to a project,
they will not be able to view it or its attendant tasks and phases
(unless they have <I>manager</I> security privileges.) When
establishing the staff resources who will work on this project, you
can also specify what their charge rates are to be. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">allocPSA allows for the flexible management of
in-house per-project rates, as well as externally charged rates which
then bring revenues into particular staff, project or departmental
cost-centres (known as Tagged Funds or TFs).<BR><BR>allocPSA also
allows you to upload (and attach) any type of electronic document to
this project's repository, as well as establish project-specific
Reminders.</P>

purpose is to provide the conduit for any and all financial
transactions with the professional services organisation's accounting
software. As such, allocPSA offers the necessary modules to conduct
financial transactional activities within allocPSA (for timesheets,
for project-related expense forms etc) as well as a <I>shadow</I> of
many of the financial transactional activities which are found in
standard modern business accounting systems, such as invoicing,
cost-centre and wages management. As with many other aspects of
allocPSA, non-<SPAN LANG="en-GB">privileged</SPAN> users will be

<H3 CLASS="western">How it Works</H3>
<P CLASS="western">This tool allows you to review, filter and drill
down into the various skillsets of your resource list as known by
allocPSA. Whilst the samples provided and screenshots shown display
IT-related skills, this module can be configured to handle any type
of skill set.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">How to Use</H3>
<P CLASS="western">You can use the first droplist to select a primary
(i.e broad) skill type, then press the <SPAN STYLE="background: #e6e6ff">'Filter'</SPAN>
button. You should now be able to drill down into the sub-categorised
skills by selecting from the secondary drop-list, once again pressing
the <SPAN STYLE="background: #e6e6ff">'Filter'</SPAN> button. At any
stage, you can print the resulting matrix.</P>
