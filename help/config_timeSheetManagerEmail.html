<u>Time Sheet Manager</u>
<br/><br/>

This person is the default Time Sheet Manager for all Projects. If a
Time Sheet Manager is specified at the Project level, the Time Sheet will get
routed to that person instead. 

<br><br>
If no Time Sheet Manager is set up at this global level or at the Project level
than the Time Sheet will skip past the Manager stage and go straight to the
Time Sheet Administrator.
