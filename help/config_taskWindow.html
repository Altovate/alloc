<u>Task Closed Window Num Days</u><br><br>

Time can be recorded against a task for this many days after a task has been closed.
<br><br>
So for example, if this value is set to 21 - three weeks - then say a task is closed
on the 5th of the month, the task assignee has until the 26st to record effort spent
for that task on a time sheet. If they wait until the 27nd, the task will have to
be re-opened first.
<br><br>
This provides some accountability for the billing of old closed tasks. And should help
improve expedient time sheeting of tasks.
