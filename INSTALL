The allocPSA Installation Guide 

Different PHP setups may produce interesting and unexpected errors and warnings. 
Please follow the directions carefully.


1) System Requirements 

    * Ensure PHP >= 4.3.0
    * Ensure PHP memory_limit >= 32 meg 
    * Ensure the GD image library is installed and PHP knows about it
    * Ensure MySQL >= 3.23 (See /usr/sbin/mysqld -V)


2) Put the source code in a directory called allocPSA in the webserver document root 

3) Fill in the values in /WEBROOT/allocPSA/util/install.cfg

4) Determine the PHP include_path 

5) As root, run the installer script 

    $ cd /WEBROOT/allocPSA/util/ 
    $ ./install.sh ./install.cfg

   Note:
    * The script should run without any FAILED messages.
    * When the script finishes it will tell you to do stuff. Do that stuff.

6) Go to the just installed allocPSA url in your web browser. Login with user and
    pass: alloc/alloc


The PHP settings for your system may generally be determined by examining 
/etc/php.ini or alternatively by putting a php script called blah.php in your 
webroot whose contents are:
<?php echo phpinfo(); ?>
Hit the script with your webbrowser eg: http://localhost/blah.php
