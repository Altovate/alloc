Hints and Tips on developing allocPSA
=====================================


Version Control
---------------

allocPSA uses darcs for version control. To check out a copy of the latest
version just run:

$ darcs get http://dev.allocpsa.net/

To commit changes back to the project, just run 

$ darcs send

Which should email the changes back to the correct place, at which point the
changes will be given a once-over and then merged back into the development
repository.


Rebuilding the CSS Files
------------------------

In the css/ directory there are many css files. There is one css file per
theme, multiplied by ten font settings.

When manipulating css you do *not* need to change those files. You just
need to change the files in the styles/ directory and then run `make css` which
should rebuild the css files in the css directory.

styles/style.tpl    ->  contains the template of the main CSS file
styles/style_*.ini  ->  contains the actual settings that get plugged into the template


Updating the Help document
--------------------------

The plaintext file help/src/help.txt contains the "source code" to the help
documents that are generated both for the html Help document that is linked to
within allocPSA, and the PDF Help document that is available for download at
sourceforge.

Simply change the help.txt file and then run `make doc_html` or `make
doc_pdf`. You will need to have docutils/rst2html installed.


Vim Settings
------------

I recommend using the following vim setting in your .vimrc. 

set expandtab
set softtabstop=2
set tabstop=2
set foldmethod=marker
set sw=2
let php_folding=1

If you wish to only enable these settings when working on the alloc project
one way to do that is to have a snippet like this in your ~/.vimrc:

if version >= 501
  if getcwd() =~ 'alloc.*'
    source alloc_vimrc
  endif
endif

And store the custom settings in that alloc_vimrc file.
